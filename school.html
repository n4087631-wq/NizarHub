        My study status was good to some extent, as throughout primary school it was excellent and sometimes more so, and while I was making this site, I was in the second year of middle school. Throughout middle school so far, my level is good, which makes me proud. But I may not excel academically during these periods because I do not study what I want and I do not study my interests, but in any case, I will study well until I reach the level at which I will study my interests.
